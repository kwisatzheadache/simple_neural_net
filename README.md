# Nn
This is a basic walkthrough of Gene Sher's "Handbook on Neuroevolution
Through Erlang," translated to Elixir. I'm new to this kind of thing, 
so expect plenty of errors along the way, as well as improperly structured
code, etc, while I learn. 


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nn` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:nn, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/nn](https://hexdocs.pm/nn).
